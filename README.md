# Turbofan Jet Engine
By Alex King

**Abstract.**
**I recently built a model of a turbofan jet engine with a cross section down the length of the engine cut out to see
the different sections of the engine. Although I thoroughly enjoyed building the model and constructing the
different parts of the engine, thatâ€™s all it was, constructing. I felt there was a significant lack of context and
explanation as to what I was building. So, in response I decided to write this document with the intention of
gaining a much better understanding of the inner workings of a commercial jet engine by visualising and
describing the sections, their components and how they work from a mechanical and thermodynamic perspective
(such that it somewhat ties into my degree).**

## Introduction
Most modern passenger and military aircraft are powered by gas turbine engines, otherwise known as jet engines.
Although there are different types of gas turbine engines, most have components and processes in common. The
standard stages for a commercial engine are as follows:

A turbofan works by sucking in air through the large fan blades at the front of the engine and dividing the air through two main paths.
The division of air is based on something called the bypass ratio, which determines the amount of air that travels through the bypass stream (funnel outside the engine core) and through the engine core. 
Commercial turbofan engines normally have quite a high bypass ratio, meaning most air that is sucked in gets routed around the engine core. 
For the air that gets sent through the engine core, it first encounters the low-pressure compressor, which increases the pressure of the air and sends it into the high-pressure compressor.
The high-pressure compressor is then able to increase the temperature of the air so significantly that when the air comes into
contact with the fuel in the combustion chamber, the combustion process starts itself. The combusted air-fuel mixture
then enters the high-pressure turbine,

## Fan
The fan of a turbofan engine is located at the front of the engine and helps the engine to generate thrust. The
purpose of the fan is to draw large amounts of air inside the engine.
