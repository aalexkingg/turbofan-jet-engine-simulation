# turbofan-jet-engine-simulation
A model of a standard commerical gas turbine jet engine in unity, showing a standard configuration of components and thermodynamic processes

### Options
Configuarble options and automatic calculations that should be considered:

- Bypass ratio
- Efficiency of the engine
- Thrust
- Nozzles
- Noise
- Altitude
- Air density
- Velocity
- Temperature
- Pressure
- Combustion

Each section should be able to seperate and the equations required for each section e.g. compressor and turbine equations should be shown.
